# Framework: Ionic
[Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) is an open source front-end framework for developing hybrid mobile apps with HTML5.

Create a Ionic app as follows:

1. Create a new workspace (Node.js or Custom for a clean workspace)
2. Open a Terminal, or using the pre-existing one at the bottom
3. Run the following commands in the Terminal:

        $ npm install -g cordova ionic
        $ ionic start myApp sidemenu
        $ cd myApp
        $ ionic serve $PORT
    
4. Click the Preview button in the top menu in the IDE, and choose "Preview with Web Server". This will open the Preview window for your running app.
