# Framework: Meteor
[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) is an open-source platform for building web apps.

Create a Meteor app as follows:
1. Create a new workspace (Node.js or Custom for a clean workspace)
2. Open a Terminal, or using the pre-existing one at the bottom
3. Run the following commands in the Terminal:

        curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
        meteor create ./my_cool_app
        cd my_cool_app/
        meteor --port $IP:$PORT
    
4. Click the Preview button in the top menu in the IDE, and choose "Preview with Web Server". This will open the Preview window for your running app. 
 
Note: Alternatively, for the last step, click on the link that's displayed in the terminal, and change it in the resulting Preview to http://127.0.0.1:8080.
