# The Editor

The editor is the most important element of any IDE; that's why Cloud9 developed [ACE](http://ace.ajax.org). ACE is a high-performance code editor for the web that supports over 40 different languages, over two dozen themes, and can still work faithfully on large documents (at last count, four million lines of code was the upper limit). It also contains a bevy of features you'd expect from traditional desktop editors. Among these include:

* Undo and Redo support
* Cut, Copy, and Paste functionality
* Line manipulation, including:  
  * Indenting and outdenting
  * Moving and copying lines up or down
  * Removing lines from any point
  * Splitting lines
* Highlighting and commenting blocks of code
* Removing words to the right or the left
* Transposing letters
* Code folding (including the entire file)
* Converting cases
* [Multiple cursors](./multiple_cursors.html)
* [Autocompletion](./autocompletion.html)
* [Code analysis and refactoring](./language_analysis.html)
* Search in files with regular expressions
* Intelligent selections, including:  
  * Selecting to word right or left
  * Selecting to line end or start
  * Selecting to document end or start
* Vim and Emacs keybindings
* Line wrapping, to a defined column or the width of the browser window
* Support for a command line
* Support for spaces and real tabs
